# stackoverflow-static

üõ† Scrape a static copy of your own StackOverflow votes data.

## Why?

* I need to quickly browse and re-learn from questions I've up-voted in the past
    * Does StackOverflow already support this? <https://stackoverflow.com> does not have search functionality for posts
      that you've up-voted. By contrast, there is a way to search for posts that you've bookmarked (n√©e favorited) using
      the search option `inbookmarks:mine`. See the search page <https://stackoverflow.com/search> for all search
      options. I've bookmarked 117 posts whereas I've up-voted 1,760 posts! **I want search coverage on my votes** (
      Hello StackOverflow, if you see this, consider this a feature request, or at least, a user experience data point!
      Thank you). Here are some related questions by other people:
        * [*How do I search for posts I've interacted on, with a particular word in
          them?*](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/302648)
        * [*Search Q or A's I've upvoted*](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/394635)
    * Why scrape the HTML for this data and not get it via
      the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer (SEDE)](https://data.stackexchange.com/)? Unfortunately, up-vote and down-vote
      data is private. It is anonymized in SEDE. The StackOverflow API also does not expose this data. So, it must be
      scraped from the HTML.
* Static content is peaceful
* This is a fun project for me
* I like JavaScript and the browser
    * Why do I like the browser so much? Among other things,
      the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN) are so amazing ü§©‚≠êÔ∏è and make it fun and rewarding
      to develop using Web APIs.

**NOTE**:

This was developed on macOS and for my own personal use.

## Design & Modes

The overall flow of the tool breaks down like this:

1. Scrape your votes data from <https://stackoverflow.com>
1. Expand the votes data into posts data using <https://data.stackexchange.com>
1. Generate a static HTML page from the posts data

There are two ways‚Äìor, *modes*‚Äìto use the tool. Choose the mode that you prefer:

* *Chrome extension* mode
    * Recommended for Chrome users
* *Manual* mode
    * Manually run the tool by executing commands in the browser developer tools and by manually moving files
    * Recommended for learning
    * This works for any evergreen browser. This mode relies on standard web APIs.

The source code is laid in a directory structure that groups code by the execution context that the code runs in:

* `src/web/`
    * The code in this directory will all be loaded on the web page. This directory might be more accurately named as
      `web-page/`.
* `src/extension/`
    * The directories in this directory are for web extensions. It breaks down into these sub-directories:
        * `common/`
            * The code in this directory gets loaded into the extension environment (background workers, popups, etc) or
              the Content Script environment (an isolated JavaScript environment with access to the web page DOM)
        * `chrome-manifest-v3/`
            * Code that supports a Manifest V3 web extension developed for Chrome.
        * `chrome-manifest-v2/`
            * Code that supports a Manifest V2 web extension developed for Chrome.
        * `firefox-manifest-v2/` NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
            * Code that supports a Manifest V2 web extension developed for Firefox. Note that FireFox does not support
              Manifest V3 as of 2021.

Note: after trial and error, I've found it difficult or confusing to define common code that gets used in both the
Chrome extension layer and the web page. So, I'm purposely designing the code base to not have any shared common code.

### My Bias Against Content Scripts

In my opinion, content scripts are not compelling and I don't quite get their necessity in browser extension technical
architecture. From my perspective there of course needs to be one isolated JavaScript execution environment that powers
an extension. Why do there need to be two? The extension context has access to powerful browser APIs. The web page
itself is a powerful execution environment because it has access to the DOM and the application source code. So what is
the place of content scripts? I know by design, they have access to the DOM while the extension environment does not.
But why? I'm sure there are good reasons. But the three different exec environments and their unique capabilities and
restrictions has made it difficult to design and implement my own code.

### My Bias for Web APIs

A corollary to my bias against content scripts is my bias for Web APIs. Specifically, I have a bias that favors using
the web page to execute a maximum amount of the tool's code. In fact, the "Manual" mode relies almost exclusively on the
web page to execute the domain logic like the data scraping and HTML generation. It requires just a bit of manual
intervention in the dev tools. As such, the "Manual" mode is perfectly portable to other browsers because it just relies
on web APIs whereas the "Chrome extension" mode is mired in accidental design complexity because of the accidental
design and implementation of non-standard APIs (Chrome-specific).

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to install the tool as a Chrome browser extension and use it:

1. Open Chrome's extension settings page
    * Open Chrome to the URL: `chrome://extensions`
1. Enable developer mode
    * Enable the *Developer mode* toggle control in the upper right corner of the page
1. Install the extension
    * Click the *Load unpacked* button
    * In the file finder window that opens, find the directory `src/extension/chrome-manifest-v3` and click *Select*
        * Alternatively, install the Chrome Manifest V2 extension in the directory `src/extension/chrome-manifest-v2`
        * Alternatively, install the Firefox Manifest V2 extension in the directory `src/extension/firefox-manifest-v2`
    * It's installed!
1. Open StackOverflow
    * Go to <https://stackoverflow.com/> in your browser
1. Log in
1. Open your profile
    * Click your picture in the top right corner to open your profile
1. Open the "Votes" tab
    * Find the "Votes" tab and click it.
    * For me, my Votes tab navigates to this URL: <https://stackoverflow.com/users/1333713/david-groomes?tab=votes>
1. Scrape the votes data
    * Click the puzzle icon in the top right of the window
    * Click the "stackoverflow-static" extension entry
    * Wait for a second (not sure why it's so slow)
    * A popup will show up letting you know that the action should have already been executed. Check the console logs!
      The votes data should have been scraped and saved to Chrome storage.
1. Expand the post data
    * Go to the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)
        * If not logged in, then log in and navigate back to the original page.
    * Repeat the earlier steps to open the extension entry
    * The same popup will appear. The post data should have been expanded and saved into Chrome storage.
    * Additionally, a new tab will open. Follow the next instructions to generate the HTML.
1. Generate a static HTML document from the posts data
    * You should be on the new tab that was automatically opened
    * A file download will appear! This is the final result. Save it somewhere easily accessible.

Follow these instructions to run the tool the manual way. It requires more steps:

1. Run a local web server:
    * `./serve.py`
    * Note: this requires Python 3
1. Open StackOverflow
    * Go to <https://stackoverflow.com/> in your browser
1. Log in
1. Open your profile
    * Click your picture in the top right corner to open your profile
1. Open the "Votes" tab
    * Find the "Votes" tab and click it.
    * For me, my Votes tab navigates to this URL: <https://stackoverflow.com/users/1333713/david-groomes?tab=votes>
1. Scrape the votes data
    * Import some JavaScript code into the browser from the web server. Paste the following into the browser console:
      ```javascript
      let el = document.createElement("script")
      el.src = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/dom-entrypoint.js"
      document.head.append(el)
      ```
    * The votes data will be downloaded in a file named `stackoverflow-votes.json`
1. Create the data directory:
    * `mkdir -p src/data`
1. Move the votes data
    * Move the downloaded votes data JSON file (`stackoverflow-votes.json`) into the `src/data` directory with the
      following command:
    * `mv ~/Downloads/stackoverflow-votes.json ~/repos/personal/stackoverflow-static/src/data`
    * The data is used in the next step.
1. Expand the post data
    * Go to the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new)
        * If not logged in, then log in and navigate back to the original page.
    * Import some JavaScript code into the browser from the web server. Paste the following into the browser console:
      ```javascript
      let el = document.createElement("script")
      el.src = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/dom-entrypoint.js"
      document.head.append(el)
      ```
    * The posts data will be downloaded in a file named `stackoverflow-posts.json`
1. Move the posts data
    * Move the downloaded posts data JSON file (`stackoverflow-posts.json`) into the `src/data` directory with the
      following command:
    * `mv ~/Downloads/stackoverflow-posts.json ~/repos/personal/stackoverflow-static/src/data`
    * The data is used in the next step
1. Generate a static HTML document from the posts data
    * Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate-html.html>
    * Import some JavaScript code into the browser from the web server. Paste the following into the browser console:
      ```javascript
      let el = document.createElement("script")
      el.src = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/dom-entrypoint.js"
      document.head.append(el)
      ```
    * A file download will appear! This is the final result. Save it somewhere easily accessible.
    * Known issue: The visual elements in the page break after the 1500th post in Chrome. I think this is because of an
      internal limit on CSS Grid sizes. See the note in
      the [CSS Grid w3 standards page](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#overlarge-grids). It mentions 1500, and 3000
      and when I go to exactly 1501 posts (there will be 2 * 1501 = 3002) the last post doesn't get rendered correctly.
      I think that's the limit. This issue does not happen Safari.

## FireFox

NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED. The Firefox extension is not yet fully implemented.
I'm blocked on:
> Unchecked lastError value: Error: An unexpected error occurred
> 
> execContentScript moz-extension://c6f78137-5e54-814f-88cf-93a433bf3cba/extension/common/extension-entrypoint.js:25

And I don't know how to see the underlying error message.

Although this tool was developed as a Chrome extension, it can also be installed as a web extension in FireFox!

Follow these instructions to install it in FireFox:

* Build the web extension for FireFox
    * `./build-for-firefox.sh`
* Open FireFox to the debug page
    * Open FireFox
    * Paste and go to this URL: <about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox>
* Load the plugin
    * Click the button with the words *Load Temporary Add-on‚Ä¶*
    * In the file finder window that opens, find the file `build/firefox-web-extension/manifest.json` and click *Open*
    * It's installed!

## Wish list

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Fix the CSS grid problem
* Consider creating a search bar where multiple terms can be search at once. Originally, I was hoping `Cmd + F` would be
  good enough for search but when the search term is SQL or bash, a lot of results come up and it's useful to add a
  second search term to reduce the result. This would add quite a bit of code to the page though.
* Consider using modules, but also consider to NOT use modules. Modules are modern, but modules aren't exported in the
  global context therefore we forego the usual luxury of "executing code ad-hoc on the console to our delight". This is
  kind of a major bummer. Also modules can't be imported in web workers in Safari and FireFox so that is also a bummer
  when considering converting this tool to a browser extension.
* Maybe the web standards for extensions APIs is actually good enough? Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera) all
  pretty much have the same APIs and FireFox also has very similar APIs. They all use the Manifest file format. Safari
  is the most different. If I can get the browser extension to be "virtually universally usable across all platforms"
  then I can do away with the manual mode, which only existed for the same reason of being usable across all platforms.
  This would loosen up the design constraints of the code architecture.
* Create an extension HTML page as an alternative to `generate-html.html`. This page will render the post data in a
  similar way but it will stop short of the downloading step. This page is meant to be used as an ephemeral view. Why?
  This is mostly just convenient so that I don't have to download the generated HTML and open it in a new tab over and
  over again while iterating on the UI.
* IN PROGRESS Build a FireFox extension for the tool. For the most part, code can be re-used, but when it comes to the
  extension APIs themselves, there are significant differences. In fact, porting the extension to FireFox has been one
  of the most challenging software efforts I've done in recent years! In part, because I've been away from JavaScript
  dev for so long but also because the standardization of extension APIs is still a work-in-progress.

## Finished Wish List items

These are the finished items from the Wish List:

* DONE Make an `entrypoint.js` file instead of re-using both `scrape-votes.js` and `expand-posts.js` independently
* DONE Get more re-use out of code. For example, re-use the Votes class between the scrape votes functionality and
  expand posts functionality
* DONE Get post data for questions that were not up-voted but where there was an up-voted answer to that question. This
  is a common case. I thought it was rare because I assumed that when I upvote an answer that I would have already
  upvoted the question. But this isn't the case. I have a about two hundred of these cases. Also, even if I wanted to
  up-vote the question, some are actually locked! For example, one of the very first things I wanted to search for in my
  SO static data was for how to get the query parameters of the URL from JavaScript. But the question and answer didn't
  show up because I didn't upvote the question, only the answer, and it turns out
  the [question itself is locked](https://stackoverflow.com/q/901115/)!
* DONE Create a browser extension for this. The main benefit should be the removal of the manual steps like opening
  three different web pages and moving the downloaded files to different directories.
* DONE (Update I think it's a race condition with the JavaScript doc load order) There are some occasional caching
  problems. Sometimes when I load a page, it saves "AppStorage" not define and stuff like that. I think it's a caching
  problem because when I "hard reload and empty caches" it works. But then later it might fail again although I haven't
  even changed the code so I don't understand how the cache could still be stale, and thus still be a problem. Not sure.
  But it's annoying.
* DONE Create a Chrome Manifest v2 extension. This would enable making a FireFox extension, which is still on v2 but is
  working on supporting v3 sometime in 2022.

## Notes

* The Chrome extension development experience is overall pretty good. I imagine it's much better than it was in the
  early years of Chrome. That said, it's difficult to debug the JavaScript code that runs in a service worker (the one
  defined by the `background.service_worker` field in the manifest. I find that 1) When it errors, there are no logs but
  just the infamous "Service worker registration failed" message in the "chrome://extensions" page and 2) I can't attach
  a debugger. The only thing I can do is comment out the whole file, and uncomment lines little by little and
  adding `console.log`
  statements.
* How many execution contexts are there? 1) The JavaScript execution environment in the page 2) The JavaScript execution
  environment that executes the extension code like the popups and 3) The JavaScrip execution environment that runs the
  content scripts? For example, I need to understand this because I'm hitting a roadblock where I want to make a Proxy
  over jQuery on the webpage, but a content script's execution environment doesn't have access to the web page's
  variables, but it does have access to the DOM (seems arbitrary to allow one but block the other, but there is probably
  a good reason). And there is a way to work around this problem anyway: inject a script element into the page itself
  from a content script. See [this StackOverflow question and answer](https://stackoverflow.com/q/20499994).
* The `let that = this` trick I have to use in the ES6 classes is a bit disappointing... how else could this code be
  designed? Is there an idiomatic ES6 class way? Or this a quirk of classes?
