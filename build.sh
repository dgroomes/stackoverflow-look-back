# Build the web extension distributions from the source code.
#
# This is a light-weight process as far as build processes go for typical software projects. All this script does is
# copy some files around. There are no dependency download steps or compilation steps.
#
# Specifically, this will create the directories:
#   * build/chromium-manifest-v2-web-extension/
#   * build/firefox-manifest-v2-web-extension/
#
# The contents of these directories are ready to be loaded into the browser as web extensions! See the README for
# instructions.
#
# Optionally, use the "--watch" option to build the distributions continually as source code files are changed. This
# requires using the "fswatch" tool. Refer to the documentation: https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch.
